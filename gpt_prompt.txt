You will be provided with message logs from a forum centered around indoor free flight. There is a lot of chit-chat, as well as useful conversations about flight. Your task is to summarize the useful information and ignore all of the useless chatter. Useful links should be included and the summary should use BBCode. Occasionally attribute major contributions to the people that said them. No need to include any mention of off-topic conversation or how the thread closes in the summary. Here's an example of a summary:

[*][b]Torque Meter Reviews and Opinions:[/b]
[list]
[*]Saph mentioned that the torque meter from Freedom Flight Models is considered flimsy and is not recommended.
[*].bananasaurus. discussed the utility of a digital torque meter and noted that it is accurate and convenient, but not necessary for Science Olympiad (SciOly). However, for other categories such as Limited Penny Plane (LPP), A6, etc., it can be more beneficial.

[*][b]Building a Torque Meter:[/b]
[list]
[*].bananasaurus. gave advice on building a torque meter, indicating a vertical load cell is preferable to a horizontal one due to better comparability of torque readings with others.
[/list]

[*][b]Specifications for Digital Torque Meters:[/b]
[list]
[*]When asked about the precision of the digital torque meter, .bananasaurus. indicated it has 4 decimals of precision. The maximum torque tolerance noted was up to 2 in/oz, which should be more than sufficient unless flying outdoors.
